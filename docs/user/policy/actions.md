# The action vocabulary

A rule names one action. The action decides which `context.input` fields the rule can read. The box
ships ten actions, and generates one more for each MCP tool it discovers.

Audience: an operator writing a `policy.dw` who needs the exact action name, its `context.input`
fields, and which part of the box raises it. [Policy](../policy.md) introduces the rules, and
[common rules](../policy.md#common-rules) shows each field in use.

> **Status.** The vocabulary can change before 1.0.0. Pin the Box build you install. A rule that
> names an action the build does not have refuses to load.

## The fixed parts

```text
@id("no_env")
forbid (principal, action == Box::Action::"fs:read", resource)
when { context.input.path == "~/project/.env" };
```

Every request is one principal, one action, one resource, and a context. In the rule above:

- **Principal** is `Box::Agent::"self"`, always. Write `principal` with no condition.
- **Action** is one of the names below. `action == Box::Action::"fs:read"` selects it.
- **Resource** is `Box::Resource::"unused"`, always. Write `resource` with no condition.
- **Context** is `context.input.<field>`, and the fields depend on the action.
  `context.input.path == "~/project/.env"` reads the `path` field of `fs:read`.

A field marked `?` below is optional. Read it behind a guard, as
`context.input has arg1 && context.input.arg1 == "-rf"`. A rule that reads an optional field with no
guard refuses to load.

The name `path` appears on two kinds of action: a filesystem path on `fs:*` and a URL path on
`http:request`. A rule that names both kinds tells them apart with `context.input has operation`,
because only `fs:*` carries `operation`.

## The ten actions

Ten actions in four categories, and one generated action per MCP tool:

- **[Filesystem](#filesystem)**, raised by Strands Shell (the box's shell) and by Monty (the box's
  Python interpreter).
  - `fs:read`: reading content or metadata, listing a directory, reading a symlink target, changing
    directory, and testing a file for execution.
  - `fs:write`: writing content, creating a directory, changing permission bits, and creating a
    symlink.
  - `fs:delete`: removing a file or an empty directory.
  - `fs:move`: renaming or moving a path, once per path.
  - `fs:other`: reserved. No operation raises it.
- **[Network](#network)**, raised by the egress gateway.
  - `net:connect`: each connection, before TLS.
  - `http:request`: each HTTP request inside the connection, after TLS on an HTTPS connection.
- **[Shell](#shell)**, raised by Strands Shell.
  - `shell:exec`: a command line that runs a program the shell implements, such as `cat` or `grep`.
  - `shell:spawn`: a command line that runs a program of the surrounding OS, such as `git`. The box
    also raises it at startup, once for each stdio MCP server `box.toml` declares.
- **[MCP](#mcp)**, raised by the MCP broker for a local server and by the egress gateway for a
  remote one.
  - `mcp:call`: each MCP request, on every method.
  - `<server>::Action::"<tool>"`: a `tools/call`, after `mcp:call` permitted it.

## Filesystem

The five `fs:*` actions carry the same two fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | String | The resolved path, spelled `~/…` under the operator's home and absolute elsewhere. |
| `operation` | `Box::Fs<Verb>Operation` | The exact verb. The table below gives the spelling and the values for each action. |

A rule spells an operation with the action's own prefix, as `Box::FsReadOperation::"read_content"`:

| Action | Spelled in a rule as | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `fs:read` | `Box::FsReadOperation::"<value>"` | `read_content`, `read_metadata`, `enumerate`, `read_link`, `change_dir`, `exec` |
| `fs:write` | `Box::FsWriteOperation::"<value>"` | `write_content`, `create_dir`, `set_permissions`, `symlink` |
| `fs:delete` | `Box::FsDeleteOperation::"<value>"` | `remove_file`, `remove_dir` |
| `fs:move` | `Box::FsMoveOperation::"<value>"` | `rename` |
| `fs:other` | `Box::FsOtherOperation::"<value>"` | `other` |

A value outside the action's set refuses to load. A value with another action's prefix loads, and
the rule matches no request. Use the prefix from the action's row in the table.

What `path` holds depends on the caller. From Strands Shell, `path` is the target with every
symlink resolved. From Monty, `path` has `.` and `..` resolved and keeps a symlink as the script
spelled it. Monty decides a path that goes through a symlink on that spelling and then refuses it,
whatever the verdict.

A rename is three or four decisions: `fs:read` and `fs:move` on the source, `fs:move` on the
destination, and `fs:delete` on the destination when it exists (`remove_dir` for a directory,
`remove_file` otherwise). All of them must permit. A denial names the path it refused.

`fs:other` is reserved: the box raises it for no operation. A rule that names `fs:other` must also
name a raised action, as `action in [Box::Action::"fs:read", Box::Action::"fs:other"]`. A rule that
names only `fs:other` refuses to load.

## Network

Each outbound call is two decisions, both of which must permit.

**`net:connect`**, once per connection, before TLS:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | String | The destination host. |
| `port` | Long | The destination port. |
| `ip?` | String | The IP address the gateway connects to, as text, such as `"203.0.113.7"`. |

Compare `ip` as a String behind a guard, as
`context.input has ip && context.input.ip == "203.0.113.7"`. An `ipaddr` comparison refuses to load
with `the types String and ipaddr are not compatible`.

**`http:request`**, once per request inside the connection, after TLS on an HTTPS connection:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | String | The destination host. |
| `port` | Long | The destination port. |
| `method` | String | `GET`, `POST`, and so on. |
| `path` | String | The URL path, without the query. |
| `body_bytes` | Long | The request body length. |
| `intercepted` | Bool | `true` when the gateway decrypted a TLS exchange, `false` for plain HTTP. |

Cloud metadata and link-local protection is two `forbid` rules on `net:connect`;
[what Box always enforces](../security.md#what-box-always-enforces) lists them.

## Shell

A command line is judged once, after the shell parses it, expands it, and resolves its first word to
a program. Each nested command, such as the one `find -exec` or `xargs` runs, is judged on its own.

**`shell:exec`**, for a program the shell implements:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | String | The submitted text. |
| `program` | String | The program the first word resolved to. A shell alias changes `command`; `program` is the resolved target. |
| `arg1?` | String | The first argument after the program. |
| `arg2?` | String | The second argument. |
| `arg_count` | Long | How many arguments follow the program. |
| `cwd` | String | The working directory. |

**`shell:spawn`**, for a program of the surrounding OS, carries the six `shell:exec` fields and two
more:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `program_path` | String | The resolved binary, spelled `~/…` under the operator's home and absolute elsewhere. |
| `credential_reads?` | Set of String | The credential stores that `box.toml` names for this program under its `[tool.<name>]` table, such as `~/.aws`. |

A rule that covers both actions names both, as
`action in [Box::Action::"shell:exec", Box::Action::"shell:spawn"]`. A `shell:exec` permit covers
the shell's own programs, and a `shell:spawn` permit covers a program of the surrounding OS. A
permitted program of the surrounding OS runs in its own sandbox, separate from the agent's sandbox
and wider than it. Its own file operations raise no `fs:*` decision;
[Security](../security.md#the-two-tiers) states that boundary.

## MCP

**`mcp:call`**, once per request on any method:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `server` | String | The server name from `box.toml`. |
| `method` | String | The JSON-RPC method: `tools/call`, `tools/list`, `resources/read`, and so on. |
| `tool?` | String | The tool, on `tools/call`. |
| `prompt?` | String | The prompt, on `prompts/get`. |
| `uri?` | String | The resource URI, on `resources/read`. |

Each stdio server in `box.toml` starts through a `shell:spawn` decision on the program its
`[mcp.<name>]` table names. A policy with no matching `shell:spawn` permit refuses the server at
startup. A permit on `mcp:call` for a server covers every method and tool on it. Refuse one tool by
name with a `tool` guard, or with the per-tool `forbid` that
[MCP policy](../mcp-policy.md#step-4-narrow-the-server) shows:

```text
forbid (principal, action == Box::Action::"mcp:call", resource)
when { context.input.server == "demo" && context.input has tool && context.input.tool == "echo" };
```

**A generated per-tool action**, `<server>::Action::"<tool>"`, carries the tool's arguments as
`context.input.<argument>`, with the types the server's `tools/list` declares. Run the
`policy generate-schema` verb to see the exact names:

```sh
./box-core/box policy generate-schema --config my-box/box.toml --output-dir ./schema
```

It writes `actions.cedarschema`, with every action and its fields, and `events.dwschema`, with what
a `when temporal` clause observes. The namespace is the server name with every character other
than a letter, a digit, or `_` changed to `_`. A leading digit gets a `_` prefix. Server `demo-mcp`
and tool `lookup` give `demo_mcp::Action::"lookup"`.

A `tools/call` is two decisions: `mcp:call` first, then the tool's generated action when one exists.
A per-tool `forbid` refuses the call. When no per-tool rule matches, the `mcp:call` verdict stands.

A few protocol methods pass with no decision, and the set depends on the transport:

| Method | Local stdio server | Server over HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | Passes | Decided as `mcp:call` |
| Each of `server/discover`, `ping`, `subscriptions/listen` | Passes | Passes |
| A notification (a frame with no `id`) | Passes | Passes |
| Every other method | Decided as `mcp:call` | Decided as `mcp:call` |

Over HTTP, each frame is also decided as `http:request` first. Because `tools/list` is decided, a
rule can refuse it and hide a server's tools.

## What a temporal rule observes

A `when temporal { … }` clause reads recorded events. The box records three events for each action
`A`:

| Event | Recorded when | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `A::request` | Every decision, permitted or denied | The action's `input` fields |
| `A::response` | The operation ended, or its end is `indeterminate` | The `input` fields, plus `output` |
| `A::error` | The operation did not happen | The `input` fields |

What each caller records as a response:

| Action | Response recorded | `output` |
|---|---|---|
| `fs:*` | When the operation ends | `result`, spelled `Box::FsResponseResult::"<value>"`: `completed`, `descriptor_issued`, or `indeterminate` |
| `net:connect` | When the connect attempt ends | none |
| `http:request` | At reply time, once per exchange | `status`: the upstream's reply status |
| `shell:exec`, `shell:spawn` | When the command ends | `status`: the exit status. When a signal ends the command, `status` is `128` plus the signal number. |
| `mcp:call` | When a `tools/call`, `prompts/get`, or `resources/read` completes | none |

Each temporal operator carries a window of at most `24h`. A temporal predicate names exactly one
action, so a budget that spans `fs:read` and `fs:write` is one clause per action.
