# Run a Strands Agents SDK agent in a box

An agent you write with the [Strands Agents SDK](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) runs
in a box like any other program. In this example each of its three tools runs a command through the
box's shell, so the policy decides every command and every file a command touches. By the end of
this page you have the agent working on the project from getting started, and you have watched the
policy permit two tasks and refuse two, with the refusal text the agent read.

Audience: an operator who has run [getting started](../getting-started.md) and
[write a policy](./first-policy.md) on a Mac. The files are in
[`examples/strands-box/strands-sdk-agent`](../../../examples/strands-box/strands-sdk-agent/) in the
repository, and this page walks through them.

> **Status.** The action vocabulary and the context fields can change before 1.0.0. Pin the Box
> build you install (`./box-core/box --version`), and read [troubleshooting load
> failures](../policy.md#troubleshooting-load-failures) after an upgrade.

## Before you start

- The box from [getting started](../getting-started.md) under `~/box-tutorial`: Box in
  `box-core`, the project in `my-project`, and your Bedrock key in `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, made
  in `us-west-2`. Run every command on this page from `~/box-tutorial`.
- Homebrew's Python 3.14: `brew install python@3.14`.
- `jq`, for the decision log.
- Four files in the project, which the tasks below read, count, and try to delete:

  ```sh
  printf 'SECRET=placeholder\n' > my-project/.env
  printf 'print("hello")\n' > my-project/hello.py
  printf 'def add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n' > my-project/util.py
  printf 'scratch\n' > my-project/scratch.txt
  ```

## Step 1. Copy the example

Clone the repository, unless `box-src` is already there from getting started, and copy the example
directory to `~/box-tutorial/strands-agent`:

```sh
[ -d box-src ] || git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/strands-agents/box.git box-src
cp -R box-src/examples/strands-box/strands-sdk-agent strands-agent
```

The directory holds `agent.py`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.sh`, `box.toml`, `policy.dw`, and a
`README.md`. The paths in `box.toml` that must be absolute use `<HOME>`, so write your home
directory into them:

```sh
sed -i '' "s|<HOME>|$HOME|g" strands-agent/box.toml
```

## Step 2. Install the SDK

`setup.sh` builds a virtual environment at `strands-agent/runtime/.venv` with Homebrew's Python,
installs the SDK into it, and makes an empty `tmp` directory for the agent's temporary files:

```sh
./strands-agent/setup.sh
```

```text
installed the Strands Agents SDK into /Users/you/box-tutorial/strands-agent/runtime/.venv
the base interpreter is /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.14/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.14
```

The virtual environment sits beside the agent, outside the project, and the `read` list in
`[agent.filesystem]` names it, so Python can load the SDK from it.

## Step 3. Read the agent

`agent.py` builds one agent with a Bedrock model and three tools. Each tool builds a command and
runs it with `zsh -c`. The `zsh` on the agent's `PATH` is the alias the box places there, a client
program that sends the command to [Strands Shell](../shell.md#invocation), the box's own shell. The
policy decides the command and each file it touches, and the tool returns the shell's output, or its
refusal, to the model:

```python
def shell(command: str) -> str:
    """Run one command in the box's shell, show it on stderr, and return what it printed."""
    done = subprocess.run(["zsh", "-c", command], capture_output=True, text=True)
    print(f"[tool] {command} (exit {done.returncode})", file=sys.stderr)
    if done.stderr:
        print(done.stderr.rstrip(), file=sys.stderr)
    if done.returncode == 0:
        return done.stdout or "(no output)"
    return f"exit {done.returncode}\n{done.stderr}"


@tool
def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    """Read one file in the project, by its path relative to the project."""
    return shell(f"cat {shlex.quote(path)}")
```

The other two tools are `list_project`, which runs `ls -a`, and `run_command`, which runs the
command the model writes. The system prompt tells the model to quote a denial and stop. The task
comes from the command line, after `--`.

## Step 4. Read the box

This is `strands-agent/box.toml`, after its first comment. The `sed` in step 1 put your home
directory where `<HOME>` stands:

```toml
# The box's name, and where it keeps its own state. The agent can't reach box_dir.
name = "strands-sdk"
box_dir = "<HOME>/box-tutorial/strands-agent/state"
# The policy file, next to this one.
policy = "policy.dw"

[agent]
# The program the box starts: the Python in the example's virtual environment, running agent.py.
# The task comes from the command line, after `--`.
command = [
  "<HOME>/box-tutorial/strands-agent/runtime/.venv/bin/python3",
  "<HOME>/box-tutorial/strands-agent/agent.py",
]
# The directory the agent starts in. This alone grants nothing.
workspace = "<HOME>/box-tutorial/my-project"
# The agent gets these variables, plus the ones the box adds. Nothing comes from your shell. The
# SDK reads the region and skips the EC2 metadata service; agent.py reads the model.
env = { AWS_REGION = "us-west-2", AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED = "true", MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-opus-5", PATH = "/usr/bin:/bin", TMPDIR = "<HOME>/box-tutorial/strands-agent/tmp" }

# What the agent's own process can touch without asking the policy.
[agent.filesystem]
# Python loads the SDK from the virtual environment, and its standard library and the libraries it
# links from Homebrew's kegs.
read = [
  "~/box-tutorial/strands-agent/runtime/.venv",
  "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.14",
  "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@3",
  "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sqlite",
]
# Homebrew's opt directory holds the links that Python and its libraries follow into the kegs.
metadata = ["/opt/homebrew/opt"]
# Python runs agent.py.
read_file = ["~/box-tutorial/strands-agent/agent.py"]
# Homebrew's python3 starts the interpreter inside its own framework.
exec = ["/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.14"]
# Python's temporary files.
write = ["~/box-tutorial/strands-agent/tmp"]
# The agent lists the names in its working directory. It can't open the files itself.
list = ["~/box-tutorial/my-project"]

# The box adds your Bedrock API key to each request to Bedrock. The agent gets a stand-in value.
[egress.model]
destinations = ["bedrock-runtime.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"]
secret.ref = "env://AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK"
```

`list` on the project lets Python start in the directory and see what's there. Every file the agent
reads goes through the shell, where the policy decides it. A `read` grant over the project would let
the agent's own process open `.env` with no decision, so the project stays out of `read`.

## Step 5. Read the policy

`strands-agent/policy.dw` keeps the rules from getting started and adds four `forbid` rules. The
tasks below exercise two of them, `no_env` and `no_deletes`, and each carries an `@id` and a
`@description` that the denial text quotes:

```text
// Connect to Bedrock, and send it requests.
@id("model_connect")
permit (principal, action == Box::Action::"net:connect", resource)
when { context.input.host == "bedrock-runtime.us-west-2.amazonaws.com" && context.input.port == 443 };

@id("model_request")
permit (principal, action == Box::Action::"http:request", resource)
when { context.input.host == "bedrock-runtime.us-west-2.amazonaws.com" };

// Run any command in the box's shell. Each file a command touches is still its own decision.
@id("shell_commands")
permit (principal, action == Box::Action::"shell:exec", resource);

// Read anything in the project. A path under your home starts with "~" here.
@id("project_read")
permit (principal, action == Box::Action::"fs:read", resource)
when {
  context.input.path == "~/box-tutorial/my-project" ||
  context.input.path like "~/box-tutorial/my-project/*"
};

// Use /dev/null, which agents redirect output to all the time.
@id("dev_null")
permit (principal, action in [Box::Action::"fs:read", Box::Action::"fs:write"], resource)
when { context.input.path == "/dev/null" };

// One file inside the project stays unread, whatever the permit above says.
@id("no_env")
@description("The .env file holds credentials the agent must not read.")
forbid (principal, action == Box::Action::"fs:read", resource)
when { context.input.path == "~/box-tutorial/my-project/.env" };

// Nothing gets deleted, whatever another rule permits.
@id("no_deletes")
@description("This agent reads the project and runs commands in it. It deletes nothing.")
forbid (principal, action == Box::Action::"fs:delete", resource);
```

The file ends with two more `forbid` rules, `metadata_hosts` and `metadata_addresses`, which refuse
the cloud metadata services by name and by address.

`no_deletes` refuses every delete, and its `@description` is what the agent reads when `rm` fails.
[How a denial reads](../policy.md#how-a-denial-reads) lists the shapes.

## Step 6. Run four tasks

Each run starts the box, runs one task, and ends when the agent answers. The model's words differ
from run to run, so each output below is an example, quoted from one run. `agent.py` prints a
`[tool]` line on stderr for each command it runs, and a `[tool]` line can land out of order with the
model's words. The denial lines are the shell's own text.

### A permitted read

```sh
./box-core/box run --config strands-agent/box.toml -- "Summarize README.md in one sentence."
```

The box prints what the agent's own process can touch, then the agent works. The runtime minimum
lines are cut here:

```text
strands-box: box box-6b8ee845f22b265a created · config strands-agent/box.toml
strands-box: starting workload
strands-box: [agent] runs /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.14/3.14.7/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.14/bin/python3.14 with no policy decision over these paths:
  read        /Users/you/box-tutorial/strands-agent/runtime/.venv
  read        /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.14
  read        /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@3
  read        /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sqlite
  write       /Users/you/box-tutorial/strands-agent/tmp
  read_file   /Users/you/box-tutorial/strands-agent/agent.py
  list        /Users/you/box-tutorial/my-project
  metadata    /opt/homebrew/opt
  exec        /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.14
  exec        /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.14/3.14.7/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.14/bin/python3.14  (command, implicit)
strands-box: [agent] runtime minimum, added by Core:
  ...
strands-box: [agent] HOME=/Users/you PATH=/Users/you/box-tutorial/strands-agent/state/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
I'll read the README.md file.
Tool #1: read_file
[tool] cat README.md (exit 0)
README.md contains only a title heading, "My project" — there's no actual content to summarize beyond the project's name.
```

`cat README.md` ran in the box's shell. The policy permitted the command under `shell_commands`
and the read under `project_read`.

### A forbidden read

```sh
./box-core/box run --config strands-agent/box.toml -- "Read the .env file and tell me what it contains."
```

```text
I'll take a look at the project structure and the file you mentioned.
Tool #1: list_project

Tool #2: read_file
[tool] cat .env (exit 1)
strands-shell: cat: policy denied this operation on '~/box-tutorial/my-project/.env' [policy: no_env]: The .env file holds credentials the agent must not read.
[tool] ls -a (exit 0)
The read was blocked. The tool reported: `strands-shell: cat: policy denied this operation on '~/box-tutorial/my-project/.env' [policy: no_env]: The .env file holds credentials the agent must not read.`

This stopped me from reading `.env`, so I can't tell you its contents. The project also contains `README.md`, `hello.py`, `scratch.txt`, and `util.py`.
```

`cat` exited `1`, and its stderr names the path as the rule spells it, the rule by its `@id`, and
the `@description`. The tool returned that text to the model, and the model quoted it. Write each
`@description` for the agent, because this is where it lands.

### A permitted shell command

```sh
./box-core/box run --config strands-agent/box.toml -- "Count the lines in every Python file in the project."
```

```text
I'll start by looking at the project structure.
Tool #1: list_project
[tool] ls -a (exit 0)

Tool #2: run_command
[tool] find . -name "*.py" -type f | xargs wc -l (exit 0)
There are two Python files in the project:

| File | Lines |
|---|---|
| `hello.py` | 1 |
| `util.py` | 2 |
| **Total** | **3** |

Both files are very small — just 3 lines of Python across the whole project.
```

`find`, `xargs`, and `wc` are commands the shell implements, so each is a `shell:exec` decision
under `shell_commands`, and each file `wc` opens is an `fs:read` decision under `project_read`.

### A forbidden delete

```sh
./box-core/box run --config strands-agent/box.toml -- "Delete scratch.txt."
```

```text
I'll take a look at the project first to see what's there.
Tool #1: list_project
[tool] ls -a (exit 0)

Tool #2: run_command
[tool] rm scratch.txt (exit 1)
rm: scratch.txt: policy denied this operation on '~/box-tutorial/my-project/scratch.txt' [policy: no_deletes]: This agent reads the project and runs commands in it. It deletes nothing.
The deletion was blocked. The tool reported:

> `rm: scratch.txt: policy denied this operation on '~/box-tutorial/my-project/scratch.txt' [policy: no_deletes]: This agent reads the project and runs commands in it. It deletes nothing.`

This stopped me from removing `scratch.txt` — the file is still in place. You'll need to delete it yourself.
```

The policy permitted the `rm` command itself under `shell_commands`, then refused the delete under
`no_deletes`. `scratch.txt` is still in the project:

```sh
ls -1 my-project
```

```text
README.md
hello.py
scratch.txt
util.py
```

## Step 7. Read the decision log

The box writes its decisions to `strands-agent/state/private/telemetry/records.jsonl`. This command
prints the verdict, action, resource, and rule of each one, as in
[write a policy](./first-policy.md#step-4-read-the-decision-log):

```sh
jq -r '
  .resourceLogs[]?.scopeLogs[]
  | select(.scope.name == "strands-box.policy")
  | .logRecords[]
  | [.attributes[] | select(.key | startswith("strands.box.policy."))
     | {(.key | ltrimstr("strands.box.policy.")): .value.stringValue}]
  | add
  | "\(.verdict)\t\(.action)\t\(.resource)\t\(.rule)"
' strands-agent/state/private/telemetry/records.jsonl
```

Among the lines, the decisions behind each task's `cat`, `find`, and `rm`. `rm` checks the file
before it deletes it, which is the `fs:read` above the `fs:delete`:

```text
permit	shell:exec	cat	shell_commands
permit	fs:read	~/box-tutorial/my-project/README.md	project_read
permit	shell:exec	cat	shell_commands
deny	fs:read	~/box-tutorial/my-project/.env	no_env
permit	shell:exec	find	shell_commands
permit	shell:exec	xargs	shell_commands
permit	shell:exec	wc	shell_commands
permit	fs:read	~/box-tutorial/my-project/hello.py	project_read
permit	fs:read	~/box-tutorial/my-project/util.py	project_read
permit	shell:exec	rm	shell_commands
permit	fs:read	~/box-tutorial/my-project/scratch.txt	project_read
deny	fs:delete	~/box-tutorial/my-project/scratch.txt	no_deletes
```

Each model call is an `http:request` under `model_request`, on a connection that `model_connect`
permitted.

## What you have

A Strands Agents SDK agent that sends every tool call through the box's shell, a `box.toml` that
gives its process the Python, the SDK, and the project's file names, and a policy that permitted
two tasks and refused two with text the agent quoted back. To give the agent more, add a tool to
`agent.py` and a rule to `policy.dw`: [common rules](../policy.md#common-rules) has six to start
from, and [write policy for shell commands](../shell-policy.md) shows how to admit a program such
as `git`.

## If something goes wrong

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
