# Telemetry

A box records every policy decision it makes, every change to its own authority, each unmatched MCP
route, and every span, log record, and metric the workload exports. A `[telemetry.*]` table in `box.toml`
declares the target those records reach, and `include` states which records that target receives.

This page covers a `file` target, which appends records to a path the operator names, and the
endpoints a box sends to directly: an `otlp` endpoint, Langfuse, LangSmith, and CloudWatch. A box
that declares no table writes to a default target. See [The default target](#the-default-target).

## The default target

A box with no `[telemetry]` table writes one file inside its own box directory:

```text
<box_dir>/private/telemetry/records.jsonl
```

That target receives every record: each effective denial, each effective permit, the box's own
control-plane records and MCP routing diagnostics, and the workload's relayed spans, log records, and
metrics. The workload cannot reach the file.

The file grows for as long as the box is used. Rotate or remove it as the operator's own task.

The file is not tamper evident. Box signs no record and chains no record to the next, so anything running
under the operator's own account can edit it afterwards. What the box keeps out is the workload.

A declared target replaces this default rather than adding to it, so a box that declares a file of its
own writes no record to `private/telemetry/records.jsonl`.

## `[telemetry.decisions]`

`[telemetry.decisions]` is the target a box declares:

```toml
[telemetry.decisions]                  # every decision this box takes, recorded
kind        = "file"
destination = "~/boxes/codex/records.jsonl"
include     = ["deny", "permit", "trace", "logs"]
```

A `file` table takes three keys. An unknown key is refused.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | string | none, required | `file`. [Endpoints](#endpoints) lists the other kinds. |
| `destination` | string | none, required | The file the records go to, as stated below. |
| `include` | array of strings | every record | Which records reach this target: `deny`, `permit`, `trace`, `logs`, or `metrics`. |

## `kind = "file"`

A file target receives one OTLP-JSON request per line, appended. Each line is a complete
`resourceLogs`, `resourceSpans`, or `resourceMetrics` request.

The destination is an absolute path, `~`, or a path that begins with `~/`. Box expands a leading `~` to
the operator's home. These destinations are refused:

| Destination | Message |
|---|---|
| A relative path, such as `records.jsonl` | ``a file destination must be absolute or begin with `~/` `` |
| A path that carries a `..` component | ``carries a `..` component`` |
| A path inside `box_dir` and outside `private/` | `is inside the box directory ... but outside its private tree` |

**Name a destination outside every path the agent may write.** Box does not compare the destination
against `[agent.filesystem]`, so a file inside a granted directory is a file the agent can truncate. The
default destination needs no such care, because it sits in the box directory, which the agent cannot
reach.

Declare one target per file. Two boxes that append to one file can tear a line.

## `include`

Omit `include` and the target receives every record. Write `include` and the target receives only the
records the words in the list name:

| Word | The target then receives |
|---|---|
| `deny` | Every effective denial. |
| `permit` | Every effective permit. |
| `trace` | The workload's own spans, and this box's control-plane records. |
| `logs` | Box's unmatched MCP routing diagnostics and the workload's log records. |
| `metrics` | The workload's metrics. |

So `include = ["deny"]` writes a file of refusals, and leaves out the permits, control-plane records,
and MCP routing diagnostics.

**The workload's log records and metrics are on by default.** They reach every target, and no value of
`include` keeps them out. The word `logs` selects Box's MCP routing diagnostics; the workload's own
logs arrive even without it. The word `metrics` is optional. The file `include = ["deny"]` writes
therefore holds the denials, plus whatever log records and metrics the workload itself exported.

`trace` names two things at once. A target that omits `trace` receives no control-plane record, so this
box's `box_started`, `policy_installed`, and `box_stopped` records are absent from it.

An empty list is refused, and so is a repeated word.

## Endpoints

An endpoint target sends each batch from the box itself, over OTLP/HTTP with protobuf. The batch
does not go through the egress gateway, and policy makes no decision for it. The workload never
holds the target's credential.

Write the vendor's kind, and Box sets the vendor's path, headers, and credential placement:

```toml
[telemetry.langfuse]
kind        = "langfuse"
destination = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com"
secret.ref  = "env://LANGFUSE_AUTH"      # public-key:secret-key

[telemetry.cloudwatch_logs]
kind       = "cloudwatch_logs"
region     = "us-west-2"
log_group  = "my-group"
log_stream = "my-stream"
secret.ref = "aws://my-profile"
```

| Kind | What it receives | What the operator writes |
|---|---|---|
| `otlp` | every payload, or the payloads `accepts` names | `destination`, and optionally `accepts`, `headers`, and `secret` |
| `langfuse` | spans | `secret.ref`, and `destination` for a region or a self-hosted Langfuse |
| `langsmith` | spans | `secret.ref`, and optionally `project` and `destination` |
| `cloudwatch_logs` | log records | `region`, `log_group`, `log_stream`, and an `aws://` or `credsd://` `secret.ref` |
| `cloudwatch_traces` | spans | `region`, and an `aws://` or `credsd://` `secret.ref` |

A vendor that takes only spans is sent no log or metric batch. That is the one exception to the rule
that the workload's log records and metrics reach every target.

[`config.md`](./config.md#telemetrylabel) lists every key, and what each kind sets.

### The credential

`secret.ref` names where the box reads the key: `env://NAME` or `secret://NAME` for a variable in the
environment of `strands-box run`, or `aws://PROFILE` or `credsd://ENVIRONMENT` for a SigV4 signature.
The box holds the key in a vault of its own for each target, and attaches it on each request. A
literal key is refused, and so is a `file://` or `op://` reference.

A credential needs an `https://` destination, unless the destination is loopback.

### Failed sends

Box sends each batch once, with a four-second deadline. A batch that fails is counted, and the box
does not retry it. When the run ends, Box prints one line on stderr with the count (see [Errors and
exit codes](#errors-and-exit-codes)). To see why a send failed, set `STRANDS_BOX_TELEMETRY_DEBUG` to
any non-empty value in the environment of `strands-box run`. Box then also prints each failure on
stderr as it happens, with its full cause and the start of the endpoint's answer:

```text
strands-box: telemetry export failed: https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel/v1/traces answered 401 Unauthorized: ...
```

## The workload's own signals

OpenTelemetry calls each kind of telemetry a signal. Three of them apply here: traces, logs, and metrics.

Box relays the workload's spans, log records, and metrics. These records exist only when the workload
exports them, so two settings apply: the workload's own exporter setting, and a target that accepts
the signal.

Box binds one loopback port for the workload and sets three variables in its environment:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, where the port is this box's own |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | the same address with `/v1/traces` appended |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | `http/protobuf` |

Box owns every name that begins with `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_`, so `[agent] env` may not set one. The
receiver answers `/v1/traces`, `/v1/logs`, and `/v1/metrics`, and answers `404` on every other route.

The exporter switches belong to the workload, so write them in `[agent] env`:

```toml
[agent.env]
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER = "otlp"
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER = "otlp"
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER = "otlp"
```

A switch left at `none` means that signal never arrives, whatever `include` names. The OpenTelemetry
default metric interval is 60 seconds, so a short run ends before the first metric leaves. Set
`OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` in `[agent] env` for a short run.

## What a record carries

Each box record names its origin on its resource:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `service.name` | `strands-box` |
| `strands.box.name` | this box's ID: the one the library caller supplied, or a generated `box-` and 16 hexadecimal characters |
| `strands.box.source` | `box` for a record the box wrote, and `agent` for a relayed payload |
| `strands.box.run.id` | one identifier per `strands-box run` invocation |

### A decision

Each effective decision produces one log record and one span that share a trace ID and a span ID. The
log record's `event_name` field is `strands.box.policy.decision`, and the scope is
`strands-box.policy`.

| Group | Keys |
|---|---|
| The decision | `strands.box.policy.action`, `.resource`, `.verdict`, `.cause`, `.reason` on a denial, and `.principal` |
| The governing rule | `strands.box.policy.rule`, `.description`, `.category`, and `.determining.ids`, which lists every policy that determined the decision |
| Correlation | `strands.box.request.id` on an egress decision, `jsonrpc.request.id` on an MCP request, and `strands.box.trace.parent_span_id` on the log record |
| What it was about | `server.address` and `server.port` on a network decision, `http.request.method` on a request, `file.path` on an `fs:*` decision, and `process.command`, `process.command_args`, and `process.working_directory` on a shell decision |

`strands.box.policy.verdict` holds `deny` or `permit`. `strands.box.policy.cause` holds one of six
values: `permitted`, `forbidden`, `no_match`, `policy_pending`, `internal_fault`, and `enforcement`.

A record whose cause is `internal_fault` also carries the key `error.type`, with the value
`strands.box.policy.evaluation_error`.

The action value carries the vocabulary term alone, so a reader sees `fs:read` rather than
`Box::Action::"fs:read"`. Every other value is reported as the enforcement point holds it. A spawn
that a tool grammar decides reports the grammar action, so `Tool::git::Action::"push"` reads as the
action `push` in the category `Tool::git`.

Two keys are excluded: `url.full` and `process.command_line`.

`process.command_args` reports each argument after expansion, because the Shell does not say which
words the script stated literally. For each argument, the record reports:

| The expanded argument | What the record carries |
|---|---|
| A short flag, such as `-l` | the flag |
| A long flag of at most 32 lowercase letters and dashes, such as `--verbose` | the flag |
| A long flag with a value, such as `--output=secret` | the name, and `<redacted>` for the value |
| Anything else | `<redacted>` |

At most 64 arguments are reported. One attribute carries at most 4 KiB, and a longer value is cut on a
character boundary and ends with `… (truncated)`.

### An unmatched MCP route

When an MCP alias invocation matches no declared command, Box writes an informational log record
with event name `strands.box.mcp.unmatched` in the `strands-box.mcp` scope.
`process.command` names the received program, and `process.command_args` follows the expanded-argument
redaction rules above. The record includes request identifiers and parent trace context when available.

The diagnostic carries no policy verdict, action, or rule. Box writes it before replying to the
alias, so it does not say whether ordinary execution starts or succeeds. It produces no span.
Targets receive it when `include` is omitted or contains `logs`.

### A control-plane record

A control-plane record states one change to the authority this box holds. The scope is
`strands-box.control`, and each operation also produces a span named `control <operation>`.

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `strands.box.control.operation` | `policy_installed`, `policy_refused`, `schema_installed`, `discovery_complete`, `box_started`, or `box_stopped` |
| `strands.box.control.outcome` | `ok`, or `refused` |
| `strands.box.control.subject` | what the operation was about |
| `strands.box.control.reason` | why a refusal happened |
| `strands.box.control.detail` | further text the operation carries |

## Reading a records file

A records file can hold several scopes, so a query selects one. A box records that it started before it
decides anything, so the first record in the file is a control-plane record.

Every denial, one per line:

```sh
jq -r 'select(.resourceLogs)
       | .resourceLogs[].scopeLogs[]
       | select(.scope.name == "strands-box.policy")
       | .logRecords[].attributes
       | map({(.key): .value.stringValue}) | add
       | select(.["strands.box.policy.verdict"] == "deny")
       | "\(.["strands.box.policy.action"]) \(.["strands.box.policy.resource"])"' \
  ~/boxes/codex/records.jsonl
```

Example output:

```text
fs:read ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

What this box did to its own authority:

```sh
jq -r 'select(.resourceLogs)
       | .resourceLogs[].scopeLogs[]
       | select(.scope.name == "strands-box.control")
       | .logRecords[].attributes
       | map({(.key): .value.stringValue}) | add
       | "\(.["strands.box.control.operation"]) \(.["strands.box.control.outcome"])"' \
  ~/boxes/codex/records.jsonl
```

Example output:

```text
box_started ok
policy_installed ok
discovery_complete ok
box_stopped ok
```

Select on `strands.box.source` to tell a box record from a relayed one. A severity number is the box's
own routing, and it is not a filter for a reader.

The file needs no conversion, so any viewer that reads OTLP-JSON opens it directly. `otel-tui` is one
such tool:

```sh
otel-tui --from-json-file ~/boxes/codex/records.jsonl
```

## Errors and exit codes

A telemetry error stops the run before the workload starts, so the agent never runs. `strands-box` prints
the reason on stderr and exits `1`.

Exit `1` alone does not prove that Box refused, because a workload is free to exit `1` as well. The
message does: Box prefixes every line it prints with `strands-box:`.

| What the operator sees | Cause |
|---|---|
| `names no signal, so nothing would reach it` | `include` is an empty list. |
| `names <word> twice` | `include` repeats a word. |
| ``a file destination must be absolute or begin with `~/` `` | A file destination is relative. |
| ``carries a `..` component`` | A destination carries `..`. |
| `is inside the box directory ... but outside its private tree` | A file destination sits where a process could truncate it. |
| ``a `<kind>` target sets `<key>` itself, so leave it out`` | A vendor kind names a key it sets. |
| `` `<key>` does not apply to a `<kind>` target `` | A key belongs to another kind. |
| ``a `cloudwatch_logs` target needs `log_group` and `log_stream` `` | A CloudWatch Logs target names no group or stream. |
| ``needs `region`, an AWS region such as `us-west-2` `` | A CloudWatch target names no region, or an invalid one. |
| `` `secret.ref` names no scheme this box reads `` | The reference is a literal value, or a scheme other than `env://`, `secret://`, `aws://`, or `credsd://`. |
| `its destination is neither https nor loopback` | A credential would cross the network in the clear. |
| `` the `aws://` credential cannot sign `` | The profile is missing, or holds no static keys. The run stops before the workload starts. |

Each message names the table it came from.

A target that fails while the box runs loses the record, and Box does not retry. When the run ends,
Box prints one line on stderr if an export to a configured target failed, or if the final export did
not finish in time:

```text
strands-box: warning: telemetry records were lost: 2 exports to the configured targets failed
```

The count is exports, not records: one export can carry many records. The run's exit code does not
change. The line does not cover everything that can be lost: a record that the telemetry queue
refuses when it is full, an agent payload that Box refuses, a batch that a slow target does not
accept before its export deadline while the box runs, and a relayed payload still in flight at
shutdown are not counted. So the absence of this line does not prove that nothing was lost.

Set `STRANDS_BOX_TELEMETRY_DEBUG` to also print each failed export as it happens, with its cause. See
[Failed sends](#failed-sends).
