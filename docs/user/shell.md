# Strands Shell

Strands Shell is the shell that runs each command the agent sends to `zsh`, `bash`, or `sh` in a
box. Policy decides each command, and each file operation the command makes. A program outside the
Shell runs in its own sandbox, separate from the agent's.

Audience: an operator with a working box from [getting started](./getting-started.md). For the
steps, read [write policy for shell commands](./shell-policy.md).

## Invocation

On the agent's `PATH`, `zsh`, `bash`, and `sh` are each the alias, a client program that sends one
command to the Shell. Each accepts one of these forms:

| Form | The Shell runs |
|---|---|
| `zsh -c COMMAND`, `-lc COMMAND`, `-c -l COMMAND`, `-l -c COMMAND` | `COMMAND` |
| `zsh SCRIPT` | The text of `SCRIPT`. The alias reads the file in the agent's sandbox, so `[agent.filesystem]` must grant the agent a read of it. |

Any other form is refused with `Shell alias accepts only -c COMMAND, -lc COMMAND, -c -l COMMAND, or
SCRIPT`.

Each invocation is one command. A variable exported in one invocation is unset in the next. The
Shell starts each command with `HOME` set to the agent's `HOME`, and with the workspace as its
working directory.

## What runs where

The reachable paths check is deny-only and runs after policy. It refuses a path outside the operator's home,
the agent's home, and the workspace, a path inside the box directory, and the `box.toml` and
`policy.dw` the run loaded, whatever a `permit` says.

Once the alias hands a command to the Shell, each command in it runs as follows:

| Inside a command, the agent runs | Action | Where it runs | What bounds its reach |
|---|---|---|---|
| A builtin or a command the Shell implements | `shell:exec`, then one `fs:*` action for each file operation | In the Shell | Policy, then the reachable paths check |
| A program on the `PATH` of `box run`, such as `git` | `shell:spawn` on the program's resolved path | Its own sandbox | Its `[tool.<name>]` table or `exec` entry. See [Configuration](#configuration). |
| A program named by a path, such as `./target/debug/app` | `shell:spawn` on the program's resolved path | Its own sandbox | Its `[tool.<name>]` table or `exec` entry |

The Shell implements these, each in place of a program of the same name on the `PATH`:

- Builtins: `cd`, `export`, `set`, `alias`, `trap`, `test`, `printf`, `echo`, `read`, `find`,
  `xargs`, and others.
- Text: `cat`, `grep`, `sed`, `head`, `tail`, `sort`, `uniq`, `cut`, `tr`, `wc`, `tee`.
- Files: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `ln`, `chmod`, `touch`, `mktemp`, `readlink`.
- Data and network: `jq`, `curl`.
- Interpreters: `lua`, and `python` and `python3`, which run in Monty, Box's Python interpreter.

Paths outside the operator's home, the agent's home, and the workspace, such as `/tmp`, exist only
in the Shell's memory, for one command. A file written to `/tmp` is gone when the command ends.

## `shell:exec`

Decided once for each command the Shell implements, after expansion, including each command that
command substitution, `eval`, `source`, `find -exec`, `xargs`, or Lua's `io.popen` runs.

| Field | Type | Present | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `context.input.command` | String | Always | The command line, rebuilt from the expanded words. |
| `context.input.program` | String | Always | The first word after expansion, such as `grep`. |
| `context.input.arg1`, `arg2` | String | When the command has that many arguments | The first and second arguments. Test each with `has` first. |
| `context.input.arg_count` | Long | Always | The number of arguments. |
| `context.input.cwd` | String | Always | The Shell's working directory. |
| `context.output.status` | Long | On a `::response` event | The command's exit status. A program that a signal ends records 128 plus the signal number. |

```cedar
@id("read_only_commands")
permit (principal, action == Box::Action::"shell:exec", resource)
when { ["cd", "pwd", "ls", "cat", "grep", "head", "tail", "wc"].contains(context.input.program) };
```

## `shell:spawn`

Decided once for each program the Shell does not implement, before Box starts it. A permit starts
the program only under the rule in [Configuration](#configuration). `shell:spawn` has every field
of `shell:exec`, with these differences:

| Field | Type | Present | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `context.input.program` | String | Always | The first word after expansion, such as `git` or `./target/debug/app`. |
| `context.input.program_path` | String | Always | The file that runs, with every link resolved. A path under the operator's home starts with `~/`. |
| `context.input.credential_reads` | Set of String | When the matching `[tool.<name>]` lists name a credential store | Each credential store those lists name, such as `~/.aws`. Test it with `has` first. |

```cedar
@id("built_programs")
permit (principal, action == Box::Action::"shell:spawn", resource)
when { context.input.program_path like "~/src/project/target/debug/*" };
```

A program's filesystem lists bound its own file operations.

## `fs:*`

Decided once for each file operation that one of the Shell's commands makes, on the path with every
link resolved.

| Action | `context.input.operation` |
|---|---|
| `fs:read` | `Box::FsReadOperation::"read_content"`, `"read_metadata"`, `"enumerate"`, `"read_link"`, `"change_dir"`, `"exec"` |
| `fs:write` | `Box::FsWriteOperation::"write_content"`, `"create_dir"`, `"set_permissions"`, `"symlink"` |
| `fs:delete` | `Box::FsDeleteOperation::"remove_file"`, `"remove_dir"` |
| `fs:move` | `Box::FsMoveOperation::"rename"` |

| Field | Type | Present | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `context.input.path` | String | Always | The resolved path. A path under the operator's home starts with `~/`, and the home itself is `~`. |
| `context.input.operation` | Enum | Always | One value from the table above. |
| `context.output.result` | Enum | On a `::response` event | `Box::FsResponseResult::"completed"`, `"descriptor_issued"`, or `"indeterminate"`. |

```cedar
@id("project_read")
permit (principal, action == Box::Action::"fs:read", resource)
when { context.input.path == "~/src/project" || context.input.path like "~/src/project/*" };
```

To print the whole action schema:

```sh
./box-core/box policy generate-schema --config my-box/box.toml --output-dir /tmp/schema
```

`/tmp/schema/actions.cedarschema` holds every action and field.

## Configuration

Policy decides whether a program outside the Shell runs. These `box.toml` keys decide where. After
a `shell:spawn` permit, the program runs under the first of these that covers it:

1. A [`[tool.<name>]`](#toolname) table that matches it.
2. An [`[agent.filesystem] exec`](#agentfilesystem-exec) entry.
3. Neither: the program is refused with status `126`.

### `[tool.<name>]`

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `command` | string array | required | Element 0 is the program, and the rest are fixed leading arguments. A bare name resolves on the table's `env.PATH`, else on the `PATH` of `box run`. |
| `workspace` | path | the Shell's working directory when it is inside the agent's workspace or a path the tool's lists name, else the agent's workspace | The program's initial working directory. |
| `env` | table | empty | Variables the program receives. |
| `filesystem` | table | empty | `read`, `write`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `list`, and `deny`: the paths the program's own system calls reach. |
| `network.contain_egress` | bool | `true` | How the program reaches the network. See [`[tool.<name>.network]`](#toolnamenetwork). |

A table matches a `shell:spawn` when its `command` resolves to the same file as `program_path`,
and its fixed arguments match the leading arguments of the command. When several tables match,
the one with the longest `command` is used. When a table names the file and none matches the
arguments, the program is refused.

```toml
[tool.git]
command = ["git"]

[tool.git.filesystem]
read  = ["~/src/project", "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools"]
write = ["~/src/project/.git"]
deny  = ["~/src/project/.env"]
```

### `[tool.<name>.network]`

`[tool.<name>.network]` holds one key, `contain_egress`. It works the same as a stdio MCP server's
[`[mcp.<name>.network]`](mcp.md#network), with one difference: with `false`, the decision log
records one `egress:native` entry each time the program runs, not once at startup.

`false` applies to a program whose client does not read `HTTPS_PROXY`, such as a client that signs
in through single sign-on:

```toml
[tool.sso-cli]
command = ["sso-cli"]

[tool.sso-cli.network]
contain_egress = false
```

The agent picks a tool's arguments, so with `false` the agent can aim the program's connections.
Don't set it on a general client such as `curl`, or on an interpreter. A program that runs under an
`exec` entry, and not a tool table, always goes through the gateway.

### `[agent.filesystem] exec`

A program that no `[tool.<name>]` table names runs with the agent's own filesystem lists when an
`exec` entry covers it and no `deny` entry covers it. An entry is a file, or a directory that
covers every file under it.

```toml
[agent.filesystem]
exec = ["~/src/project/target/debug"]
```

## `PATH`

A bare program name in a command resolves on the `PATH` of the host OS's shell that runs `box run`, else on
`/usr/bin:/bin`.

## `curl`

`curl` sends each request through the egress gateway, which decides `net:connect` and
`http:request` ([how Box controls outbound traffic](../design/egress.md)). A request the gateway
refuses makes `curl` exit non-zero.

## Exit statuses

| Status | Meaning | stderr |
|---|---|---|
| `125` | Box failed to serve the command. | The failure |
| `126` | Policy refused the command. | `strands-shell: effect denied: policy denied this operation on '<program>'`, then `[policy: <id>]` or `[default-deny]` |
| `126` | Policy permitted a program, and nothing in [Configuration](#configuration) covers it. | ``strands-shell: <program>: no tool runs <path>: no `[tool.<name>] command` matches this program and its leading arguments`` |
| `127` | The program is not in the Shell, and not on the `PATH`. | `strands-shell: <program>: command not found` |
| Any other | The command's own status. A refused file operation fails the command that made it, for example `cat` with `1`. | `policy denied this operation on '<path>'`, then `[policy: <id>]` or `[default-deny]` |
